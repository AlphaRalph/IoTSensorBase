<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![IoT SensorBase][product-screenshot]

The aim is to develop a sensor platform, which is independent of the measured variables, records data and sends it to a cloud service.
In cloud services this data is analysed and visualised.

Project scope:
* Familiarisation with current IoT technologies
* Creation of a universal software architecture
* Realisation of a showcase, e.g."environmental measurement"

Fields of activity:
* Software development/programming with .NET, Python
* Database and SQL
* Cloud services
* Sensors
* Communication (WIFI,LTE etc)

<!-- discussion -->
## Discussion

From a set of keywords to a concept idea.
What did we <a href="docs/DISCUSSION.md">discuss</a> about before the project started.

At the end we agreed the following architecture:

<!-- Getting Started -->
## Getting Started

<a href="docs/OVERVIEW.md">Getting Started Guide</a> includes a description of how to get the solution run.

<!-- Roadmap -->
## Roadmap

In our project we identified four main topics:

* **reading data from various sensors and write data to database**
- [x] implement template for micro service 
	- [x] write data to MongoDB at localhost
	- [x] acquire temperature and humidity from sensor
	- [x] acquire CO2 level from sensor
- [x] autostart micro services at startup
- [ ] ...

* **establish a connection to cloud and send data in correct format**
- [x] implement a device gateway to connect to source DB and MQTT-Broker
- [ ] handle KEY Files for authentification and authorisation
	- [x] creation of KEY Files is done manually
	- [ ] fully authomated handling of new devices
- [x] retriev data from the source DB cyclically
- [x] forward data to configured outbound channel
- [x] IoT topic can be configured (could be a serial number)
- [x] outbound channel sends all data one by one 
	- [ ] outbound channel can be configured to send all data in a bulk
	- [ ] outbound channel can be configured to compress data
- [x] multiple channes are configurable
- [x] inbound data is sent to all outbound channels
- [x] after exception connections are restored

* **store received data in cloud database**
- [x] how to handle message from MQTT broker
- [x] which database should be used
- [x] how to store in Database

* **visualize data**
- [x] what tool can be used for visualisation
- [x] what database can be used as source for visualisation
- [x] how to realise dashboards
